Small language models are efficient because they require less computational resources while still providing good performance for many tasks.

When optimizing a language model for Mac M1, you should use half-precision (float16) to reduce memory usage and improve performance.

The advantages of deploying AI on edge devices include reduced latency, improved privacy, and lower operational costs.

Quantization is a technique that reduces model size by representing weights with lower precision, such as int8 instead of float32.

MobileBERT is a compressed version of BERT designed specifically for mobile and edge devices with limited resources.

Distillation is the process of training a smaller model (student) to mimic the behavior of a larger model (teacher).

ONNX Runtime provides optimizations for running machine learning models across different hardware platforms.

TinyBERT achieves comparable performance to BERT while being much smaller through parameter reduction and knowledge distillation.

Edge AI refers to running artificial intelligence algorithms locally on a device, rather than in the cloud.

Pruning is a technique that removes less important weights from a neural network to reduce its size.

The Metal Performance Shaders (MPS) framework in macOS allows for GPU acceleration on Apple Silicon chips.

Batch processing improves throughput by processing multiple inputs simultaneously, utilizing hardware more efficiently.

ALBERT reduces model size by factorizing embedding parameters and sharing parameters across layers.

Model compression techniques aim to reduce the size and computational requirements of neural networks while preserving accuracy.

Transformer models can be made more efficient by reducing the number of attention heads and hidden layers.
